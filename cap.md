# for my capstone project, I am in a group of four and we are desigiing a solition for offline LLMs.

It has been very fun, and we are using a NVIDIA Jetson. Our core product is an app that serves as an LLM switcher, with a pretty GUI. It has been VERY fun for me to learn how all of that sort of stuff works, and how hardware can be very limiting for ofline llms.
